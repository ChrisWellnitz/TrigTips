✨tips and tricks ✨
---------------------------
-  For all of them: Try and actually understand why each one is the way it is, that is much better than just trying to jam them all in your head, also helps when you have a memory slip on a test or something. If you understand the methodology behind it, you'll be golden

-  For the even/odd ones, if you know what the graph looks like, just think about it in your head and you should be good, if not, idrk, just do your best

- For pythagorean identities, some kid in my math class came up with a really stupid group of phrases that somehow actually helped me, you just gotta be careful with them

- phrases below
    "sincos = 1"
    "cot = csc" (pronounced cot = sesc)
    "tan = sec" (pronounced tan = sec)
- I say you should be careful cuz you gotta remember they're all squared, and you gotta remember that cotangent and tangent have ( + 1 )


- For the sum and difference identities, I really have no tips, your sorta just have to memorize them. You can kinda get away with just know sine and cosine, and just deriving tangent on the test, but thats kinda risky especially if you dont fully understand rules and stuff.
    ∓ just means it's the opposite sign
    ± means it is the same sign

- For the double angle identities, quite frankly you dont even need to know these at all, you can literally just derive them from the sum identities without much difficulty, theyre really only if you wanna hit peak efficiency

- For half angle identities, you really just gotta memorize the basic format and know that sine is negative ( - ), and cosine is positive ( + )
Once again, tangent is just kind of annoying, theres two of them and they dont really follow the pattern of sine and cosine
- Knowing what a conjugate is also helps
